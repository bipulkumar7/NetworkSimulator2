###About NetworkSimulator-2 in my career.

- I had started working on this project during my academic year, that was near around november 2012. Where i had used NS-2 for my minor project, and NS-2 with emulation for major project.
- I have finally found github as a medium to illustrate and show my work for NS-2 , And also i would like to welcome other interested people to work on my project.
- I am mainly focused on the area of emulation.
