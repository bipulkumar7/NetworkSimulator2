Network Simulator2 with emulation. 
=========================================================================
Ns is a discrete event simulator targeted at networking research. Ns provides substantial support for simulation of TCP, routing, and multicast protocols over wired and wireless (local and satellite) networks. 

Emulation refers to the ability to introduce the simulator into a live network. Special objects within the simulator are capable of introducing live traffic into the simulator and injecting traffic from the simulator into the live network. There are two primary types of uses for such a facility, depending on whether the simulator appears to end stations as a router or as another end station. In the first case, live traffic can pass through the simulator (transparently to endpoints) and be affected by objects within the simulation, or by other traffic on the live network. In the second case, the simulator can include traffic sources or sinks that communicate with real-world entities.
